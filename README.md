# AI Resume Matcher: Generative AI Prototype

This project explores a prototype AI-powered assistant designed to help users assess how well their resume aligns with a given job description and identify areas for improvement.

The system combines document understanding, structured generation, and semantic similarity to:
- Parse resumes and job descriptions using large language models
- Generate structured JSON outputs from unstructured text
- Compute semantic matches between resumes and job roles using embeddings and vector similarity
- Produce personalized, actionable resume improvement suggestions using few-shot prompting

This project simulates how modern generative AI systems can streamline recruiting and personal branding workflows, demonstrating practical applications of LLMs in intelligent decision-support tools.
